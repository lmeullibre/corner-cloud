# Corner Cloud

Corner Cloud is a personal project in which I aim to understand the infrastructure, challenges, problems and state of the art of the Cloud Gaming industry. There are few companies dedicated to it, and much of the code is not open source, and other key principles of the industry are a big mystery to me. It is important to keep in mind that cloud resources (GCloud, Aws, Azure ... ) are expensive, so an important goal of this project is to achieve the best possible optimisation, in order to be able to run expensive games on hardware resources while spending as little money as possible.

This monorepo contains the frontend and backend code for the main service, which provides authentication, session management, queueing and resource management for a correct resource layout. 

All code related to the infrastructure will be uploaded soon.
